<div class="lede"><p>As programmers we believe that the true nature of code exists in a text file. A good programmer can construct the magic sequence of characters in their head and their fingers blur as they stream line after line of code into the keyboard without error.</p>
<p>Is this reality? Not even close. There are many problems with representing and editing code in text and we're so used to them just we don't see it.</p></div>

<p>The vast majority of code is written through some kind of text editor, whether it's notepad, a sophisticated IDE, or a heavily customised Vim environment. These tools mitigate common text editing problems like unclosed brackets and syntax errors, but can't eliminate them completely. </p>
<p>In this talk we'll explore the underlying nature of code as a tree structure using Python's abstract syntax trees, and we'll compare real world examples of coding interfaces which represent these trees in different ways.</p>
<p>So much of our thinking and tooling revolves around code being represented as text files that to step outside of this world means re-imagining how version control works and what real programming even is.</p>
