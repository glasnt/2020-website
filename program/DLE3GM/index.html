<p>Did you see something AMAZING at PyConline that you really want to tell your opinions about? Have a cool project that you want to share with the world? Can you rant for 5 minutes about the history of hardware shop consolidation (please don’t do this) in New South Wales in the 20th century? Then we have just the opportunity for you!</p>
<p>We’re hosting Lightning Talks on Sunday afternoon, where we’ll be hosting 5-minute talks (strictly timed) on whatever topics occur to the PyConline AU crowd over the weekend.</p>
<p>Lightning talks are fast, fun, and a great way to present your first conference talk, or to share something that’s too weird or small to fit into a full-length talk.</p>
<p>You can talk about any topic, but it should be reasonably interesting to the PyConline AU crowd, and MUST meet the standards set by the PyConline AU Code of Conduct.</p>
