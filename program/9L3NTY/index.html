<div class="lede"><p>Biometrics are widely regarded by the public, and many developers, as heightened security. Their actual track record tells a very different story. Biometric technologies are systematically making the world a less safe place. We have an obligation to do something about that. And we can.</p>
<p>In this talk, you'll learn about the breathtaking range of biometrics being tracked and assessed. You'll learn about dangerously wrong conclusions being drawn. You'll learn about spurious underlying premises and untrustworthy training data, and widespread misuses that are determining life and death decisions in government, policing, and health monitoring.</p>
<p>Most importantly, you'll learn how to assess these technologies, and avoid contributing ito their development, misuse, and proliferation.</p></div>

<p>Examples are drawn from a globally geographically diverse range of areas.</p>
