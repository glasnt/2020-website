<div class="lede"><p>It feels like it should be easy, but its not... you think, “it shouldn't take too long“, wrong again.
This talk is about some things you should think about/read about/know about as you dive into geospatial data. It will present some tools, videos, websites, etc, which might be useful as you forge your own path on the map of possibilities. Just an overall solid 25 minutes of geo-goodnes... with python!
The aim of this talk is to inspire you to cross over to the geospatial side of data if you have not already, to give you some pointers if you are on your way, and to make you laugh/sigh at all the stuff you have had to learn to be where you are if you have been at it for a while.</p></div>

<p>Here is my top level summary:
- its hard for everyone, you are not alone. 
- snacks:
  - points, lines and polygons
  - projections (<em>scream quietly into the void</em>)
  - WKT
  - file types
  - "simple" calculations
- pantry:
  - libraries
  - useful stuff on the internet
  - quick wins
  - other software
  - debugging
- dinner:
  - interesting problems
  - other fun things</p>
