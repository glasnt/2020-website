<div class="lede"><p>Headless Wagtail + GatsbyJS Progressive Web App Generator - in the style of modern static site generations, pre-fetched to provide a speed and performance. Can I build something really cool, quickly? We have the power of two of the most popular frameworks, proven to scale with some of the largest software products in the world.</p></div>

<p>Exploring if a GatsbyJS progressive web app generator frontend with a headless Wagtail backend could be a solution for small-sized clients and personal projects when I want to "whip something up" quickly without sacrificing design, performance/hosting costs, user or site editor experience (Can I have it all)? Gatsby (https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a open source framework based on React. Wagtail (https://wagtail.io/) is a Django CMS with LOTS of cool features for content creators, and "plays nicely with everything else in your tech stack" (source: Wagtail) because its built on and easily integrates with all uses of Python. </p>
<p>Why? Not only do I enjoy the new and shiny things as a consultant, both Wagtail and GatsbyJS are established frameworks and active communities that put considerable effort in providing a great product with a smooth developer experience. We enjoy the benefits of Django / Wagtail CMS, with a incredibly fast pre-fetched progressive web app with GatsbyJS. The goal is nice, fast and fun. </p>
<p>I am approaching this talk by walking through how I started out with minimal experience with GatsbyJS or GraphQL, and moderate experience with React and headless Wagtail to creating and deploying (Netlify) this app. I am not an expert in either technology, but was able to quickly navigate getting started as well as identify lots of resources in both communities to build out in a more complex experience.</p>
