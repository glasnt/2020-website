<div class="lede"><p>Asynchronous Celery tasks that manipulate a MySQL/Galera database from a Django application can produce very interesting behavior when HAProxy is involved. This talk discusses these issues, and proposes remedies available to both application developers and infrastructure operators.</p></div>

<p>When you’re running a Django application, the following things are all pretty commonplace:</p>
<ul>
<li>You use MySQL or MariaDB as your Django database backend.</li>
<li>You don’t run a single standalone MySQL/MariaDB instance, but a Galera cluster.</li>
<li>You run asynchronous tasks in Celery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now suppose your application doesn’t talk to your Galera cluster directly, but via HAProxy. That’s not exactly unheard of; in fact it’s an officially documented HA option for Galera. And, to complicate things further, this may be a feature of your setup that you, the application developer, don't necessarily have control over.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, you may be dealing with very "interesting" features of HAproxy which — if you are unfamiliar with them — can throw you very nasty curveballs.</p>
<p>Having been in the position where, together with my team, I <em>was</em> indeed unfamiliar with some of HAProxy's/Galera's intricacies and we were thus on he receiving end of those curveballs, I am taking this opportunity to share our findings so that our pain is someone else's gain. You have multiple options at your disposal — some in your infrastructure setup, and some in your Django application code. This talk covers both those angles.</p>

I ran hastexo, a small professional services company specializing in OpenStack, Ceph, and Open edX, until our acquisition by City Network in October 2017.
