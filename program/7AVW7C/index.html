<div class="lede"><p>Approximately 20% of the world's population has some form of disability.  Despite this, the vast majority of software isn't fully accessible.  Making your systems readily usable for everyone is a complex process.  Using good design principles and following the WCAG standards is a starting point, but how can you be sure that you're meeting the guidelines?  And what if your users have access issues that aren't covered by the standards?</p>
<p>In this talk, we'll learn how to meet a variety of accessibility requirements by breaking down a series of real-world case studies.  We'll look at why it's important to evaluate the accessibility of your software, what goes wrong when assessments don't happen, and how to apply these lessons to design systems that work for everyone.</p></div>

<p>This talk consists of the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduction and Definitions</li>
<li>How good design principles can improve accessibility</li>
<li>Resources for accessible design</li>
<li>The benefits and limitations of guidelines</li>
<li>Case Study: Designing for visually impaired users</li>
<li>Case Study: Designing for screen reader users</li>
<li>Case Study: Safe design for people with photosensitive epilepsy</li>
<li>Case Study: Conveying information without using colour</li>
<li>Case Study: Conveying information without using audio</li>
<li>Case Study: Accessibility and security of medical devices</li>
<li>Case Study: Access for disabled people in the tech industry</li>
<li>Summary and Questions</li>
</ul>
