         <h1 id="code-of-conduct">Code of conduct</h1>
<p>All attendees of PyConline AU agree to be bound by the Linux Australia code of conduct.</p>
<p>Linux Australia aims to provide fun, welcoming and professional environments so
that diverse groups of people&mdash;regardless of age, race, gender identity or
expression, background, disability, appearance, sexuality, walk of life, or
religion&mdash;can get together to learn from and be inspired by each other about
all things Free and Open Source.</p>
<p>Linux Australia is committed to the ideals expressed in our <a href="http://linux.org.au/values">Values
Statement</a> and ask all our members, speakers,
volunteers, attendees and guests to adopt these principles. We are a diverse
community.
Sometimes this means we need to work harder to ensure we're creating an
environment of trust and respect where all who come to participate feel
comfortable and included.</p>
<p>We value your participation and appreciate your help in realising this goal.</p>
<h2 id="safety-team-transparency-reports">Safety team transparency reports</h2>
<p>This year's event safety team, comprised of Maia Sauren, Russell Keith-Magee, Eliza Sorensen, Ned Letcher, Nicky Ringland, Tom Eastman, and Linda McIver, provided the following transparency report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Three incidents were noted by the safety team during Pyconline-AU 2020, all mild, and all dealt with swiftly.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Inappropriate comment in Education track 04/09/2020 09:13 ACST</em>: A user noted to a member of the Safety team that someone had posted a mildly sexist comment in the public chat channel of he Education track on Venueless. The comment appears to have been aimed at the people running the Education track, with whom he has a pre-existing relationship. The reporter was notified that members of the Safety team were in the channel to keep an eye on things. No further action was taken.</li>
<li><em>Inappropriate pronoun field contents in a Venueless user's profile, 05/09/2020 14:00 ACST</em>: Following an anonymous report of inappropriate contents in a pronoun field, a safety team member contacted the user and asked them to change their pronoun field to something more appropriate. The user removed the field contents within 30 minutes.</li>
<li><em>Lightning talk should have been preceded by trigger warning, ~12:00 ACST</em>: A lightning talk containing swearing and mentions of genocide, mental illness and depression was not told to be preceded by a trigger warning. The speaker had been asked whether their talk should have one. Lightning talk czar has since apologised for this via his personal twitter account. The speaker was contacted and responded positively. A trigger warning will be added to the video.</li>
</ul>
<p>Addendum:</p>
<p>The safety team was asked to cast their eyes over a Python developer community survey to gather feedback about dependency specification. No issues were noted with the survey.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The safety oversight group, which is a part of the PyCon AU Steering Committee and comprised of Christopher Neugebauer, Katie Bell, and Richard Jones, provided the following transparency report:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In July, before the conference took place, a volunteer made comments in the Organiser's Slack that implied support for certain high-profile persons who hold transphobic viewpoints. Several other volunteers and core organisers made comments that resulted in an argument. No attempt was made to de-escalate the argument. Subsequently, the volunteer who made the original comments resigned their position with the conference. The PyCon AU Steering Committee's Safety Oversight Group communicated individually with all of the parties to the conflict, and posted a statement to the organisers' Slack, which affirmed that transphobic viewpoints will not be tolerated, but that moments of conflict should not be allowed to escalate. The Safety Oversight Group also provided resources to de-escalate conflict when it arises.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="how-to-make-a-report">How to make a report</h2>

<p>All presentation material should be suitable for people aged 12 and above.</p>
<p>Any public presentation which is part of any event, including but not limited

<li>exclusionary language;</li>
<li>insults or ad-hominem attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Presenters are asked to avoid language which is not appropriate for an
all-ages audience as much as possible.</p>
<p>If the subject matter of the presentation cannot be presented
adequately without including language that could be considered
offensive, this should be pointed out in advance, at the
beginning of the talk and in the schedule.</p>
<p>If presenters are unsure whether their material is suitable, they are
encouraged to show it to the conference’s speaker liaison or mailing
list/forum moderators before their session.</p>
<h2 id="be-aware">Be aware</h2>
<p>We ask everyone to be aware that we will not tolerate intimidation,
harassment, or any abusive, discriminatory or derogatory behaviour
by anyone at any event or online.</p>
<p>Complaints can be made to the organisers by contacting the registration desk
or mailing list/forum moderators by contacting the relevant email addresses.
All complaints made to event organisers will remain confidential and be taken
seriously. The complaint will be treated appropriately with discretion. Should
event organisers or moderators consider it appropriate, measures they may take
include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the individuals may be told to apologise</li>
<li>the individuals may be told to stop/modify their behaviour appropriately</li>
<li>the individuals may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if the
  behaviour continues</li>
<li>the individuals may be asked to immediately leave the venue and/or will be
  prohibited from continuing to attend the event</li>
<li>the incident may be reported to the appropriate authorities</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-does-that-mean-for-me">What does that mean for me?</h2>
<p>All participants, including event attendees and speakers must not engage in
any intimidation, harassment, or abusive or discriminatory behaviour.</p>
