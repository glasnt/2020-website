         <h1 id="about-the-content-of-your-talk">About the content of your talk</h1>
<h2 id="updating-your-talk-information">Updating your talk information</h2>
<p>If you need to update your talk information, you can <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/">edit your accepted submission</a> on Pretalx.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, we need you to <strong>tick the consent box that says we're allowed to stream your content</strong>, otherwise we can't! You'll also be able to select whether you want to present live or pre-record, and optionally add content warnings if necessary (please read below for more detail on that).</p>
<p>In addition to that, you can make changes to your title, abstract, bio, and so on.</p>
<p>If you don't let us know that you want to pre-record by updating Pretalx before 15 August, we'll assume that you're presenting live.</p>
<h2 id="conduct-and-expectations">Conduct and expectations</h2>
<p>Please ensure your talk content and slides comply with <a href="/conduct">our code of conduct</a>. This includes your own behaviour as well as anything you endorse or encourage.</p>
<p>In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't include content where you attack or pentest conference networks, conference infrastructure, conference processes, or conference attendees, in any way.</li>
<li>If you are talking about past hacks or social engineering, you must have had informed consent for any system or person affected, and you must clearly indicate that this was the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're not sure whether something you want to present complies with the code of conduct, or you want more information, contact <a href="mailto:speakers@pycon.org.au">speakers@pycon.org.au</a>.</p>
<h2 id="content-warnings">Content warnings</h2>
<p>If your talk contains content that you think might be sensitive, distressing or traumatic to some people (even if most people will be fine with it) please add a content warning, which you can do by <a href="https://pretalx.com/pycon-au-2020/me/submissions/">editing your accepted talk proposal</a> in Pretalx.</p>
<p>Content warnings aren't a moral judgement on your talk, and they won't restrict who is able to watch it. In fact, the opposite is true&mdash;for some of your audience members, if they know something they find distressing is coming up, they'll be better able to handle it than if it's a surprise. That lets them look after their mental health <strong>and</strong> better engage with and learn from your talk!</p>
<p>Some examples of content warnings follow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This talk contains extensive discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout.</p>
<p>This talk contains images and brief mentions of bushfires and other natural disasters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Content warnings don't exempt you from the code of conduct.</strong> This is for things that comply with the code of conduct, but might be distressing to some people.</p>
