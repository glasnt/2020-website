bio: <p>I'm a researcher at the Australian National University, and maintain a number
  of packages - mostly focussed on testing.  When not at my desk grumbling about the
  buggy state of software, I can be found with a book, a block of chocolate, and a
  plan to go somewhere out of phone range for a walk.</p>
