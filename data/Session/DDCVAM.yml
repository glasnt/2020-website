abstract: <p>How well do you think you understand time? All kinds of things in our
  lives rely on having at least a basic understanding of how "time" works. But sometimes
  you need more than just a basic understanding... so come with me on a brief tour
  of time.</p>
description: <p>This is a whirlwind tour of modern timekeeping. From the weird and
  wonderful timekeeping of astronomers, to what goes into the normal civil time you
  read on your watch. With fun stops through calendaring, atomic clocks, GPS, space
  probes, and more along the way! As programmers, we work with dates and times on
  a regular basis and while most of us will never come across a TAI timestamp, or
  convert from UTC to TCB, there is a rich history behind our modern timekeeping with
  all its wonderful acronyms. Regardless of your level of skill or familiarity with
  timekeeping, I hope you can get something out of this introduction to timekeeping,
  illustrated with Python where applicable.</p>
