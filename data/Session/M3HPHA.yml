abstract: <p>One of the most important but overlooked aspects of developing a Machine
  learning model is how the categorical variables have been encoded or represented
  to the underlying predictive algorithm.An expertise in ability to handle categorical
  variables can some times be more powerful than using the state of the art Machine
  learning models.We will learn  some of the best methodologies in the Industry for
  handling categorical data and will also discuss some quick intuitions on when to
  try what.</p>
description: "<p>When developing a predictive machine learning model for a tabular\
  \ data problem, we are normally inundated with variety of predictive features to\
  \ try out.The features are a blend of numerical and categorical features.When handling\
  \ the categorical features normally an analysts defaults to the most convenient\
  \ method or most documented method on the web or on stack-overflow forums.But this\
  \ is where there is a high possibility of missing out on significant predictive\
  \ gain by representing a feature to an algorithm in a format where it adds the most\
  \ to overall predictive efficiency . </p>\n<p>This talk aims to share a quick overview\
  \ of categorical encoding techniques and some time-tested intuitions on when to\
  \ use what.</p>"
