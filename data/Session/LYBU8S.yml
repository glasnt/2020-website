abstract: <p>The number of machine learning algorithms available and the options presented
  for their configuration presents a bewildering array of choices. This talk will
  discuss strategies and algorithms for making these choices in a principled way.</p>
description: <p>The world of machine learning is like a restaurant that presents an
  incredibly complex menu. There are so many choices for modelling algorithms and
  settings that it's hard to keep up.  This talk discusses strategies for handling
  these choices in a principled, simple manner.</p>
