abstract: <p>Cities have locked down and we have no idea when we’ll be able to host
  large outreach events in person again. How do we persevere with our mission to get
  girls involved with tech?  Can we sustain the communities built up over years online
  and maintain impact and enjoyment?</p>
description: "<p>The Girls’ Programming Network has a well tested-formula for creating\
  \ communities of girls and women centred around a passion for coding. But when pandemic\
  \ strikes, is maintaining communities based around connecting with hundreds of like-minded\
  \ people even possible? Is it even possible to run an online event that upholds\
  \ our values? And will kids even want to sign up for more hours of online learning?</p>\n\
  <p>I’ll take you through how we devised a plan to keep the GPN spirit alive online,\
  \ with a dynamic schedule of learning, socialising and fun! I’ll show you the tech\
  \ that made it all possible, tell you the lessons we learnt along the way, and let\
  \ you in on some of the things we’ll be keeping in the long term.</p>"
