abstract: <p>With data-science teams increasingly requiring domain knowledge, transforming
  a group of domain specific engineers into a functioning data-science team can be
  a challenge. In this talk we will explore how a team of engineers moved from a tangled
  MATLAB codebase to a functioning Python data-analysis pipeline, and some of the
  lessons learned along the way.</p>
description: "<p>This talk centers around an early stage start-up reaching the scale-up\
  \ phase of growth and having to move from an ad-hoc collection of MATLAB scripts\
  \ to a functioning Python analysis pipeline. All while transforming a team of mechanical\
  \ engineers into a functioning software engineering and data-science team.</p>\n\
  <p>I will paint a picture of the work we do, and how the product was first created\
  \ - including the wild selection of technologies, before talking about some of the\
  \ challenges faced in migrating a large monolithic product to a modular codebase.\
  \ I’ll discuss some the advantages and pitfalls of using Python, and how we trained\
  \ non-software engineers to produce quality code.</p>\n<p>The talk has something\
  \ for everyone, whether you’re a tech-lead responsible for training &amp; developing\
  \ your team, a business leader in a scaling startup, or a junior engineer thinking\
  \ about how to improve.</p>"
