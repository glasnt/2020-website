abstract: "<p>All professionals possess some measure of expertise, and not only is\
  \ this expertise useful, it is usually also necessary to do the job. In general,\
  \ this expertise is viewed as a good thing.</p>\n<p>But what if there is an issue\
  \ with expertise? Is expertise always a good thing?</p>"
description: "<p>This presentation will discuss how expertise has limitations when\
  \ it is applied outside its normal area of application, and how these limitations\
  \ will typically not be evident to the individual applying the expertise. Further,\
  \ even in situations where evidence suggests the application of the expertise is\
  \ inappropriate, it is likely that an individual will continue to apply their expertise\
  \ regardless of its inappropriateness.</p>\n<p>To explore these issues the presentation\
  \ will examine the behaviour of a group of firefighters fighting a wildfire in Mann\
  \ Gulch in the US in 1949, it will look at psychological studies that examine the\
  \ concept of Priming, and it will discuss how the game of baseball can assist in\
  \ unravelling why expertise can sometimes let us down.</p>\n<p>Content Warning:\
  \ This presentation will discuss bushfires and fatalities.</p>"
