description: <p>Streamlit is a framework that allows you to build interactive analytical
  apps very rapidly. It is gaining popularity among data scientists and analysts around
  the world as it helps them make a data dashboard that is elegant and aesthetically
  pleasing. In my presentation, I’ll briefly state what is Streamlit and how it is
  super useful for data scientists and analysts. I’ll then go over the basic Streamlit
  components and examples that demonstrate how easy it is to make an interactive data
  dashboard in Python. (Yes you heard it right, no JavaScript required :D) By the
  end of this talk, you’ll know the basics of Streamlit and would be able to build
  an interactive web application for data visualization and analysis with just a few
  lines of code in Python.</p>
