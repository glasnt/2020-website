abstract: <p>It’s a Friday night and you’re really hitting it off with the customer
  service assistant that has popped up in the right hand corner chat window of your
  web browser. But are they real, or a chatbot? How do you tell?</p>
description: "<p>Chatbots have become commonplace in our lives. These days, you may\
  \ find they are largely used as a form of customer service. But how does it make\
  \ us feel when we know we’re talking to a program? A poor interaction can sour the\
  \ user’s experience and put them off using a product.</p>\n<p>There is an art to\
  \ making programmed responses feel natural. It’s not just about replying to our\
  \ questions with the correct answer. Chatbots need to be programmed with the same\
  \ abilities humans have to communicate. They need to be able to listen, understand\
  \ and remember. This gives them the context of the conversation. So where do you\
  \ start?</p>\n<p>In this talk i’ll cover some of the core concepts behind how web\
  \ chatbots work, strategies used to train them to feel more human, and some Python\
  \ tools that you can use to start building your own.</p>"
