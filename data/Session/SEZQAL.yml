abstract: "<p>There exists some beautiful mathematical models of economies and disease\
  \ that offer insights, for instance, into how our economies can crash. Traditionally,\
  \ exploring these models have involved a lot of specialist mathematical programming.\
  \ Here we showcase a small python framework that simplifies the programming of these\
  \ kinds of models by leveraging python libraries such as dash and scipy. The framework\
  \ exposes a built-in UI that allows an interactive exploration of how economies\
  \ might collapse, or diseases break out into epidemics.</p>\n<p>This talk contains\
  \ discussion of epidemiological modelling of COVID-19, and of measures of violence\
  \ in a nation state.</p>"
