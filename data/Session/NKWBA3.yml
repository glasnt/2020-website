abstract: <p>List comprehensions, decorators and white space are some of the well-known
  killer features of Python. But what about the humble queue? They're elegant, have
  a wide variety of uses and help you to avoid a large class of programming errors.
  We live in an asynchronous world with many things going on at the same time. Queues
  help us manage that complexity. In this talk, we explain some of the super powers
  of queues and how you can use them to turbocharge your next project.</p>
