abstract: <p>This talk will be an introduction and overview of these Graph databases
  that are so hot right now, and how you can drive them using python.</p>
description: "<p>Relational and NoSQL DBs have ruled the roost for a couple of decades\
  \ now, but in real life there's more to data than just tables or key-pairs. Graph\
  \ DBMS technology has been coming along for the last decade-or-so and is now quite\
  \ mature. Everyone wants one, just ask a Fortune 500 company. </p>\n<p>I mean: why\
  \ have a table when you can have a knowledge graph? Why not be able to whip up a\
  \ recommendations engine (or indeed a fraud detector) in a few minutes?</p>\n<p>Graph\
  \ databases store data in Graphs -- that is NOT chart-visualisation nor syntax standard\
  \ on API layers (NOT a GraphQL talk), but per the paper written by the mathematician\
  \ Euler in 1736: those data structures which are \"nodes\" connected by \"relationships\"\
  .</p>\n<p>This talk will be a primer on what this all means, how they work and when\
  \ they're a good idea to use. There will also be a demonstration and discussion\
  \ about how to kick off with graph DBs driven by python, specifically for people\
  \ who are familiar with conventional databases, but have never used Graph databases\
  \ before, but might be curious.</p>"
