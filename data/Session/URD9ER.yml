abstract: <p>What exactly is contact tracing, and how can Bluetooth help to slow the
  spread of a pandemic? How can I balance my own privacy with communal health? Can
  a simple app actually make it safe to go back to the football?</p>
description: "<p>As health authorities raced against the clock to restrict the spread\
  \ of the Novel Coronavirus, bringing cities to a standstill, software developers\
  \ too were racing to build a technological innovation. Their solution was ⁎✧˚₊ an\
  \ app ༚⁎✧⁺  that would mystically allow you once again to go to the footy, hang\
  \ out in pubs, return to work, and re-open the economy.</p>\n<p>With the Australian\
  \ Government running an unprecedented campaign to get as many people as possible\
  \ to download their particular app, what this app actually does is still widely\
  \ misunderstood. Furthermore, the app is somehow supposed to be safe and protect\
  \ your privacy, whilst still being useful enough to track you and provide that information\
  \ to medical contact tracers. How can that even work?</p>\n<p>In this talk we will:\n\
  </p><ul>\n<li>discover what contact-tracing is and why it is vital to curb the spread\
  \ of the coronavirus</li>\n<li>explore how technology can be used to assist in the\
  \ contact-tracing process</li>\n<li>analyze the COVIDSafe mobile apps for iOS and\
  \ Android,</li>\n<li>discuss why you should, or shouldn’t, install COVIDSafe, and\
  \ how contact-tracing apps try to balance personal security and privacy with the\
  \ health needs of the greater community</li>\n</ul><p></p>\n<p>Those who attend\
  \ this talk will learn about bluetooth-assisted contact tracing, exposure notification,\
  \ and the shiny new new COVID-19 settings on their mobile phone</p>"
