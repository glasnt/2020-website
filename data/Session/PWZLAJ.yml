abstract: <p>Online Python programming course offered in response to a COVID-19 pandemic
  lockdown</p>
description: '<p>During the pandemic lockdown of COVID-19, we found a very different
  context from the usual: a) students with much more time available for learning b)
  many students who did not have a personal computer and could only access classes
  by cell phone c) difficulty to realistically assess learning. In this lecture we
  will present the real experiences in a traditional programming course given during
  the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>'
