abstract: "<p>Before I went to uni - I had around 8 years of python experience, and\
  \ so I thought learning C would be trivial, and was excited to move on from C back\
  \ to python. However, it was much more difficult than I expected! There were areas\
  \ in C that were super easy to grasp thanks to my python experience, but there were\
  \ areas that were harder to grasp as a result of of my python experience...</p>\n\
  <p>Now I'm a tutor for the university teaching C!  I now ask the question - is teaching\
  \ C better than teaching Python for formal CS education?</p>"
description: "<p>This talk is simply one about my experience of learning C from a\
  \ python background\n  - what python features helped me understand C better (control\
  \ flow, algorithm and problem breakdown design, functions, etc)\n  - what C features\
  \ helped me understand python better (ie pointers in C helped me understand python\
  \ lists, etc)\n  - how I use my python knowledge to teach C at University</p>"
