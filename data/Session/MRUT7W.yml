description: "<p>Find the slides at: https://github.com/JackMcKew/pyconau-2020-github-actions-and-python</p>\n\
  <p>GitHub Actions are free-to-use, plug &amp; play blocks of continuous integration\
  \ / continuous delivery (CICD). </p>\n<p>This talk will go into how GitHub actions\
  \ help me maintain my open source Python packages (Pandas_Alive), and how I released\
  \ my own GitHub Actions for automating the packaging of Python code to executables\
  \ with PyInstaller.</p>\n<p>Tutorial blog posts I've written:</p>\n<p>https://jackmckew.dev/github-actions-for-cicd.html</p>\n\
