abstract: <p>This talk covers the devops for a data pipeline channeling images from
  a self-hosted Passive Rain Radar in Nairobi to WebApps, Mobile apps and bots in
  Twitter and WhatsApp. The idea was put together in a restaurant and hastily deployed
  by 2 engineers. It continues run (and to fail in weird ways) 6 months in. Shoestrings
  hold together a service with 1000's of users with around 70% uptime.</p>
description: "<p>In Australia we are used to live radar images provided by Bureau\
  \ on Meterology (BoM). This agency provides forecasting and myriads of other services\
  \ and has around 500 million in Annual budget. This is not the case in developing\
  \ countries like Kenya where the last operational weather radar instrument was seen\
  \ some 30 years ago. </p>\n<p>Frustrated with the lack of live radar while in Nairobi\
  \ a couple of engineers put together a passive radar system with an SDR and an Intel\
  \ NUC. The data from this system travels via S3 and DynamoDB from screen capture\
  \ tools on the endpoint device. Eventually gets exposed via API's to web and mobile\
  \ apps running on some EC2 boxes ( no fancy kubernetes cluster to see here) . There\
  \ are also a couple of Cron Jobs acting as Twitter and WhatsApp bots for followers.\
  \ All this scratching your own itch infrastructure has slowly improved in uptime\
  \ to 70% and supports around 5000 regular users. The entire data pipeline and web\
  \ applications are written as set of small Python Services using Flask, OpenCV and\
  \ ImageMagick.</p>\n<p>This talk will describe how the pipeline was put together\
  \ incrementally with intermediate outputs and rapidly deployed using a basic <code>git\
  \ pull</code> based workflow. Along the way we will enumerate the numerous gotchas\
  \ including the excessive S3 List usage, power failures on sensor site and dogpiling\
  \ Twitter bots.  The budget for the operations remains 100's of dollars per month.</p>"
