abstract: <p>This talk introduces dask-image, a python library for distributed image
  processing. Targeted towards applications involving large array data too big to
  fit in memory, dask-image is built on top of numpy, scipy, and dask allowing easy
  scalability and portability from your laptop to the supercomputing cluster. It is
  of broad interest for a diverse range of data analysis applications such as video/streaming
  data, computer vision, and scientific fields including astronomy, microscopy and
  geosciences. We will provide a general overview of the dask-image library, then
  discuss mixing and matching with your own custom functions, and present a practical
  case study of a python image processing pipeline.</p>
description: "<p>Image datasets are large, and becoming larger. The widely used benchmark\
  \ dataset COCO (Common Objects in Context) contains 330,000 individual images. The\
  \ average size of a single entry on the image database EMPIAR is over 1TB, and can\
  \ easily reach several terabytes.  Even where individual images are small enough\
  \ to fit in-memory, many existing parallelization methods are difficult to scale\
  \ seamlessly between a laptop and a supercomputing cluster. For instance, the python\
  \ multiprocessing module is restricted to a single mode and can't take advantage\
  \ of multiple compute nodes on a distributed supercomputing cluster.</p>\n<p>We\
  \ need easy ways to work with large image data. This talk introduces dask-image,\
  \ a python library for distributed image processing. The target audience are python\
  \ programmers currently using numpy and scipy with large array data, where the whole\
  \ dataset cannot fit in memory or is close to that limit. It's for people who want\
  \ to get started with parallel processing, either because they have large single-image\
  \ data, or because they want to do batch processing applying the same analysis to\
  \ many smaller images (sometimes known an embarrassingly parallel problem). The\
  \ specific image analysis functions provided by dask-image are of broad interest\
  \ to a diverse range of analysis applications including (but not limited to) video/streaming\
  \ data, computer vision, and scientific fields including astronomy, microscopy and\
  \ geosciences.</p>\n<p>Specifically, this talk will cover:\n* An overview of the\
  \ dask-image library\n    * Lazy image loading\n    * Image pre-processing functionality\
  \ (convolutions, filters, etc.)\n    * Analysis of segmented images (distributed\
  \ labeling, and measurements of those label regions)\n* Mixing in your own custom\
  \ analysis functions (using dask delayed, map_blocks, and map_overlap)\n* A practical\
  \ case study of a Python image processing pipeline</p>\n<p>dask-image is open source,\
  \ released under a BSD 3-Clause license, and can be installed using conda or pip.\
  \ You can find the source code at https://github.com/dask/dask-image and the quickstart\
  \ guide at https://github.com/dask/dask-examples/blob/master/applications/image-processing.ipynb</p>"
