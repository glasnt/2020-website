abstract: <p>Staircase is a new python package on the data analysis scene, providing
  a framework built around the notion of step-functions.  A rich variety of methods,
  which follow from the algebra of functions, including arithmetic operations, relational
  operations, logical operations allow for sophisticated analysis which may otherwise
  prove challenging or time consuming.  In addition, the package provides functionality
  for univariate analysis, aggregations and compatibility with pandas.Timestamp.</p>
description: "<p>This talk introduces the Staircase package â€“ a new open source package\
  \ with applications in data analysis.  It aims to take the audience on a journey\
  \ from basics to more advanced usage at a comfortable pace.   A tutorial-esque style\
  \ will be used to introduce fundamentals, followed by four examples abstracted from\
  \ real world use cases.</p>\n<p>If you work with timestamped data and enjoy a little\
  \ bit of math, mixed with a terrible sense of humour, then this talk could be right\
  \ up your alley.</p>"
