abstract: "<p>The Python Global Interpreter Lock is an eternal monster under the bed\
  \ of developers, but it doesn't need to be. This talk will teach you how to take\
  \ the GIL into account when deploying and scaling Python applications in containers:\
  \ what it means for ops teams, how to design a good Python deployment, and how to\
  \ ensure it isn't negatively impacting your systems.</p>"
description: <p>This talk covers a very basic introduction to the Python Global Interpreter
  Lock from the point of view of container operations and deployment, along with the
  knowledge and tools to architect high quality Python application infrastructure.
  This includes how various application servers interact with the GIL, what problems
  is causes from an ops-centric point of view, and best practices for running Python
  applications efficiently and at scale despite the limitations.</p>
