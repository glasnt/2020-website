abstract: "<p>Biometrics are widely regarded by the public, and many developers, as\
  \ heightened security. Their actual track record tells a very different story. Biometric\
  \ technologies are systematically making the world a less safe place. We have an\
  \ obligation to do something about that. And we can.</p>\n<p>In this talk, you'll\
  \ learn about the breathtaking range of biometrics being tracked and assessed. You'll\
  \ learn about dangerously wrong conclusions being drawn. You'll learn about spurious\
  \ underlying premises and untrustworthy training data, and widespread misuses that\
  \ are determining life and death decisions in government, policing, and health monitoring.</p>\n\
  <p>Most importantly, you'll learn how to assess these technologies, and avoid contributing\
  \ ito their development, misuse, and proliferation.</p>"
