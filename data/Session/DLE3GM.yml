  \ fun, and a great way to present your first conference talk, or to share something\
  \ that’s too weird or small to fit into a full-length talk.</p>\n<p>You can talk\
  \ about any topic, but it should be reasonably interesting to the PyConline AU crowd,\
  \ and MUST meet the standards set by the PyConline AU Code of Conduct.</p>"
