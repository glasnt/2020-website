  of the shadows and into the light.</p>
description: "<p>We've all done it. Setting up a Slack to chat to our colleagues when\
  \ the proper system doesn't cut it. Forwarding a document from work to our personal\
  \ email address so we can read it on the device we want to. Building out experimental\
  \ services on our personal AWS accounts because we couldn't get the permissions\
  \ we needed on the company's systems.</p>\n<p>Every organisation's infrastructure\
  \ has its shadow, the unofficial system of servers, accounts, and hardware that\
  \ crisscrosses and bypasses the sanctioned pathways. It is every security department's\
  \ nightmare and every development team's open secret. From the newest graduate to\
  \ the CEO, we all know at least some of these shortcuts.</p>\n<p>This talk is a\
  \ space for both confession and redemption: in it, we will delve into the psychology\
  \ that leads to the development of shadow IT, the opportunities that can grow out\
  \ of this corporate underground, and how to get these systems out of the shadows\
  \ and into the light. Developers and security professionals alike will emerge from\
  \ this talk with the tools they need to build the systems they actually want.</p>"
