abstract: "<p>In games development and computer graphics, one is sometimes limited\
  \ when designing assets such as textures, models and level designs by hand. An entirely\
  \ handcrafted game is limited in content to that which the creator specifically\
  \ put in. Procedural generation remedies this by using a combination of algorithms\
  \ and stochastic aspects to programmatically certain kind of data, in this case\
  \ terrain and game assets, in quantities beyond that which would be possible to\
  \ design manually</p>\n<p>This talk will cover the process of procedurally generating\
  \ a landscape using open-simplex noise and adding realism using simulated erosion.</p>"
description: "<p>Procedural generation is the process of programmatically creating\
  \ data. Its value is in generating large quantities of similar but not identical\
  \ assets such as textures and models. This talk will cover the topic of using procedural\
  \ generation to create a landscape, which will give an illustration of the strengths\
  \ of procedural generation and ways to overcome its weaknesses.</p>\n<p>More specifically,\
  \ the topics covered are:\n- using layered opensimplex noise to create a heightmap,\
  \ as well as an overview of types of noise and the shortcomings of purely noise-based\
  \ terrain\n- using image processing techniques to add mountain ranges in a manner\
  \ more consistent with real-world geography than noise alone would allow\n- further\
  \ enhancing the terrain by converting it from a heightmap to voxels, and then applying\
  \ an erosion simulation</p>"
