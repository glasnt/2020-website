abstract: <p>Data science and software engineering are getting more and more intertwined
  with each other. But what is the common grounds between the two? How do we define
  the boundaries of the two disciplines? This talk will discuss the role of python
  in terms of development process for software engineers working in a data science
  environment. We will also tackle the different aspects of software engineering in
  relation to working with a data science oriented team.</p>
description: "<p>In this session, I will discuss the software engineering side of\
  \ data science and how python bridges the gap between data science and software\
  \ engineering.</p>\n<p>Will highlight some of the challenges involved in working\
  \ with data scientists. Will also demonstrate some sample codes and best practices\
  \ that shows how to work as a software engineer in a data science company. Lastly,\
  \ I will discuss how software engineers can shift to a more data science related\
  \ job like a data engineer.</p>\n<p>Outline:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Intro: Data science\
  \ vs software engineering</li>\n<li>Challenges working with a data science team\
