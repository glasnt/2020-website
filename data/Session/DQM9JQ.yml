abstract: <p>You know what happens inside your test functions, but what machinery
  operates around that to put the dots (or E's and F's!) on your screen? This talk
  will open up the internals of Django's test framework and describe the various steps
  of the test process, and some examples of customzing it.</p>
description: <p>Testing frameworks do a lot of work for us, so much that they can
  even appear like magic. But if we go under the hood, we can find better ways of
  working with them. This talk looks at Django's testing framework and pytest together,
  so it can show the common features as well as the differences. The general test
  lifecycle will be examined, from start to finish. We'll then use this knowledge
  to write a couple of customizations.</p>
