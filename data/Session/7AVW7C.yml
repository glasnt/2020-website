abstract: "<p>Approximately 20% of the world's population has some form of disability.\
  \  Despite this, the vast majority of software isn't fully accessible.  Making your\
  \ systems readily usable for everyone is a complex process.  Using good design principles\
  \ and following the WCAG standards is a starting point, but how can you be sure\
  \ that you're meeting the guidelines?  And what if your users have access issues\
  \ that aren't covered by the standards?</p>\n<p>In this talk, we'll learn how to\
  \ meet a variety of accessibility requirements by breaking down a series of real-world\
  \ case studies.  We'll look at why it's important to evaluate the accessibility\
  \ of your software, what goes wrong when assessments don't happen, and how to apply\
  \ these lessons to design systems that work for everyone.</p>"
