<h1>Conference Program & Registration</h1>
<small>Published 12 August, 2020</small>
 <p>Today we have not one, but two announcements. In one fell swoop, we’re releasing both the program schedule, and ticket registration for PyConline AU. Tada!</p>
<h2 id="tickets-registration">Tickets &amp; Registration</h2>
<p>We’re excited to share that tickets are now available for PyConline AU!</p>
<p>As with previous years, we have several types of tickets priced at different levels. Importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributor tickets</strong> are our top tier ticket. Contributors are recognised as minor sponsors because the ticket price helps fund outreach and diversity programs (such as covering affordable access for students). This year you can also “pay what you want” above the listed price.</li>
<li><strong>Professional tickets</strong> are for professional Python users attending the conference. If your employer is paying for your ticket or you make a living using Python, please consider this tier.</li>
<li><strong>Enthusiast tickets</strong> is your ‘general admission’ ticket to the conference, regardless of your python proficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Student tickets</strong> are available for anyone enrolled in full or part-time  educational courses at any level. (Where possible, please register using your Australian education institution email address).</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll have more to share about our (extremely) online conference venue in the next few weeks. For now, you can expect to receive an invite link to your registered email address closer to the date. If you purchase multiple tickets (e.g. for a team to attend the conference), you’ll be prompted to enter an email address for each attendee so they can receive their invite links nearer the time.</p>
<p>To register, head on over to <a href="https://pycon.org.au/attend">https://pycon.org.au/attend</a> and hit the big green <strong>“register now”</strong> button. It looks a lot like this one:</p>

    </a>
</p>

<h2 id="conference-program-session-schedule">Conference Program / Session schedule</h2>
<p>Also going live today is the conference schedule! Head on over to <a href="https://pycon.org.au/program">https://pycon.org.au/program</a> to see our 5 fantastic specialist tracks, and 74 exciting talks!</p>
<p>The conference schedule is slightly shorter this year running over three days instead of five. Like you, we’re also spending a lot of time in front of screens at home and we’ve been extremely mindful to ensure there are scheduled breaks and some time to spend offline as well.</p>
<p>On <strong>Friday 4 September</strong>, our 5 specialist tracks will stream in 4 virtual rooms.  There are 39 sessions for you to choose from on Friday, or pick a single track and stay tuned all day.</p>
<p>On <strong>Saturday 5 September</strong> we’re running what’s traditionally referred to as the ‘main conference’, a day full of talks on all sorts of wide ranging topics. There are 35 talks vying for your attention on Saturday including our deep dive sessions, and a new format to PyConline AU - 15 minute short talks.</p>
<p>On <strong>Sunday 6 September</strong>, we’ll be running mentored sprints. The sprints are an opportunity for attendees to contribute back to an open source project. While there are no scheduled talks on the Sunday, the sprints will be run in a way so that both seasoned and first time contributors can participate remotely. We’ll have more to announce on the mentored sprints (and other social activities) "<em>soon</em>".</p>
<p>To discuss these announcements, please join us for our regular Wednesday evening news stream. The stream will be embedded in this news post and is scheduled for tonight, at <time datetime="2020-08-12T19:30+09:30">7:30PM ACST 12 August 2020</time>.</p>
